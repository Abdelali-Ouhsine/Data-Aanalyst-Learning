Tableau Sales & Performance Dashboard
Project Overview

Companies accumulate large amounts of business data such as sales, returns, customers, products, and customer satisfaction. When analyzed correctly, this data provides valuable insights into business performance and supports strategic decision-making.

This project uses Tableau to connect multiple data sources, define key performance indicators (KPIs), and build an interactive dashboard that allows users to analyze sales, profitability, customer behavior, and satisfaction.

Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

Import and connect multiple data sources

Clean and prepare data for analysis

Create hierarchies and grouped dimensions

Build interactive and meaningful visualizations

Design a final dashboard driven by KPIs

Use calculated fields and parameters to enrich analysis

Data Import and Modeling
Data Connections

The following physical joins are applied in Tableau:

LEFT JOIN: Purchases to Reviews

LEFT JOIN: Purchases to Returns

INNER JOIN: Purchases to People

A logical relationship is created between Purchases and Evaluations to preserve order-level granularity (for example, average customer satisfaction per order).

Measure Formatting

Default formats are defined as follows:

Sales: Currency

Profit: Currency

Quantity: Integer

Customer Satisfaction: Percentage or integer

Hierarchies and Groupings

The following hierarchies are created:

Product Hierarchy

Category

Subcategory

Product Name

Geography Hierarchy

Country

Region

City

Subcategory values are grouped where necessary to simplify analysis and improve dashboard readability.

Basic Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

Sales by Subcategory with reference labels

Sales by Segment

Quantity by Product Hierarchy

Customer Satisfaction per Order (using logical relationships or LOD expressions if required)

Sales over Time with day, month, and year granularity

Data refreshes are performed to ensure responsiveness and accuracy.

Advanced Visualizations and Interactivity

Advanced charts and interactions include:

Map showing Sales by Country or Region

Bubble Chart showing Sales by Segment

Interactive Filters:

Country

Date

Quantity

Segment

Graph Matrix (Small Multiples): Segment by Region by Subcategory

Mirror Chart (multi-measure comparison)

Dual-Axis Chart comparing Sales and Quantity

Reference Lines displaying targets or objectives per partition

Tables and Reporting

The following tables are created:

Simple table with Category, selling price, and total sales

Multidimensional table with multiple dimensions in rows and columns

Conditional formatting (for example, sales below target highlighted in red)

Pivot table to analyze intersections

Multi-measure table displaying several KPIs side by side

Calculations and Parameters
Profit Percentage Calculation

A calculated field is created to represent profit as a percentage of sales:

Profit Percentage = Profit / Sales

Conditional Eco-Tax Calculation

A calculated field applies a 5% eco-tax under the following conditions:

Applies only to products in the technology category

Does not apply if the product name indicates it is recycled

Products outside this category are excluded from the calculation

Low Sales Flag (Discrete Measure)

A Boolean calculated field is created to identify low sales:

TRUE if total sales are less than 1000

FALSE otherwise

This field is used for conditional formatting or filtering.

Dynamic Profit Parameter

A parameter named "% Profit Increase" is created and displayed in the dashboard.

This parameter is used in a calculated field to compute adjusted profit:

Adjusted Profit = Profit * (1 + % Profit Increase)

The value changes dynamically based on user input.

Final Dashboard

The final dashboard includes the most relevant visualizations and KPIs:

Interactive filters and parameters

Clear titles, legends, and consistent color usage

Optimized layout for readability

Fully tested interactivity

The dashboard supports both high-level monitoring and detailed analysis.

If you want, I can also:

Shorten it for a one-page README

Add a KPI dictionary (definition + formula)

Rewrite it for academic submission or professional portfolio
